# Mupen64Plus encoder
This project makes use of [mupen64plus-core-rr](https://github.com/Madghostek/mupen64plus-core-rr) to encode N64 TASes on the command line.

It is a WIP at the moment, and when finished, will comprise:
- utility classes for interfacing with Mupen64Plus (done)
- a wire-tap audio plugin, since there are no hooks for recording audio
- an FFmpeg-powered encoder
